# Vehicle Trajectory Forecasting: A classification approach

## Implementation of LSTM and Transformers for trajectory forecasting.

This is the code for an advanced machine learning project conducted at Link√∂ping University. The project focuses on vehicle trajectory forecasting using Encoder-Decoder architecture. Two models are implemented: a transformer model and a LSTM model.

### Dataset

the preprocessed datasets used to train and evaluate both the transformer and LSTM model can be found in the _preprocessed_data_ folder.

### Transformer

Transformer training and evaluation scripts are found in the Transformer_model folder, follow the instructions in the README file in the folder.

### LSTM
LSTM training and evaluation scripts and instructions are found in the README in the LSTM folder.
