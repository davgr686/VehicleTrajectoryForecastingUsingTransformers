# Vehicle Trajectory Forecasting: A classification approach

## Implementation of LSTM and Transformers for trajectory forecasting.

This is the code for an advanced machine learning project conducted at Link√∂ping University. The project focuses on vehicle trajectory forecasting using Encoder-Decoder architecture. Two models are implemented: a transformer model and a LSTM model.

### Dataset

the preprocessed datasets used to train and evaluate both the transformer and LSTM model can be found in the _preprocessed_data_ folder.

### Transformer

#### Requirements to run the Transformer model

- Pytorch 1.0+
- SKlearn
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Pandas
- Utm

to train and evaluate the transformer model, follow the instructions in the README file in the folder _Transformer_model_.
