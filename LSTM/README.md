## Requirements

- Tensorflow 
- Keras
- SKlearn
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Pandas
- Utm

### Train LSTM

Training LSTM Models is done in LSTM_Training.ipynb

Configurable to any input data and variable input and output sequence lengths.

### Evaluate LSTM

Evaulate and predict trajectories with Validation_LSTM.ipynb

Predict by setting the same input and output length the loaded model was trained with.
