### Train Transformer

To train a transformer model, open the _Train_with_Transformer.ipynb_ and set the parameters. All adjustable parameters can be found in the second cell.

### Evaluate Transformer

Run _Predict_with_Transformer.ipynb_. In this notebook, you can also do a simple visualization of the predictions. You can also choose to use pretrained models, which are located in the _Pretrained_models_ folder.
